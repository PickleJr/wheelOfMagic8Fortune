To run locally:
You need npm installed.
Once this project gets downloaded or cloned, run "npm install" in powershell/terminal/command prompt/etc to install dependencies. From there, run either "npm start" or "npm run build". NPM start will start a server instance that you can access on your web browser at localhost:8080. If you make a change in the source file, the update will apply automatically, no refresh needed! If you run npm run build then the src folder will be compiled into static web pages. This is the development build.
